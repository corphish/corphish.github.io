                    <h3>Privacy Policy</h2>
                    <p>This page contains about what data does Custom ROM Manager uses, collects and shares. Please take your time to go through this section and know more about the same.

                    <h6>What data does Custom ROM Manager use?</h6>
                    Custom ROM Manager works with the files (.zip files specifically) present on your device. As it targets Android O, it is required to ask storage permissions on Android 6.0 and above, and it can access files depending on whether storage permissions are available or not. It is highly recommended to grant storage permissions because without it, app is basically useless. It is also guaranteed that the app does not modify/write user files without his/her consent. Additionally, the app uses root access to write the recovery script used for flashing (which is done only with the user's consent), and root is also used for some file management operations on memory card as Android Framework does not provide a straightforward way to operate on them.
                    <h6>What data does Custom ROM Manager collect?</h6>
                    Custom ROM Manager only collects crash reports, analytics data based on app usage. This is done to fix bugs and improve UX. The collected data is only used internally and not shared whatsoever. It is also guaranteed that the app does not collect any data outside the scope of the app whatsoever.
                    <h6>What data does Custom ROM Manager share?</h6>   
                    Custom ROM Manager <em>does not</em> share any data it collects to anybody else. The data collected is only used internally solely for the purpose of improving app.
                    <p></p>   
                    <p>Custom ROM Manager highly respects the privacy of the users, and it only uses the data it needs to function and improve.</p>
